// TimeoutConstant is a constant which holds how long any incoming request should wait until we timeout.
// This is useful as some calls from the Go backend to the external API may take a long time.
// If the user decides to refresh or if the client is polling, multiple requests might build up. This timecaps them.
var TimeoutConstant = time.Second * 20
